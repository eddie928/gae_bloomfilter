This is a GAE compatible bloomfilter in pure python. Just include the 2 folders in src/ and you're ready to go.

The only thing it doesn't support is reading and writing to files. I don't think you can do that on GAE to local disk anyway.

Usage is the same as pybloom: https://github.com/jaybaird/python-bloomfilter

Credits go to pybloom and BitVector!
